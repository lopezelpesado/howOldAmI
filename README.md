# howOldAmI

I'm always forgetting how old I am and WolframAlpha, while great, is a bit slow. I want to create a tool that will tell me how much time has elapsed since a certain time, namely my birthday.

## ideas

- enter date, shows you how many full years have passed since then
- options to change how time elapsed is displayed
- show months, days etc.
- option to input time as well as date and display hours, mins, secs since
- "dark mode", tells you how far through the average lifespan, maybe on country basis
